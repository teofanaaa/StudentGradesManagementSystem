# StudentGradesManagementSystem
Application manages students' grades. The app can be used by teachers and students as well. 

<h1>Description</h1>
This system is built with Java and JavaFx. For its development I used:
 <ul>
  <li> 
    Apache Derby - a relational database management system (RDBMS) that can be embedded in Java programs.
  </li>
  <li>
    Java Mail API - a platform-independent and protocol-independent framework to build mail and messaging applications. 
  </li>
  <li>
    Jfoenix - an open source java library, that implements Google Material Design using java components
  </li>
  <li>
    iText 5.5.8 - to convert HTML code in PDF format
  </li>
  </ul>
<h1>Usege</h1>
Three types of users can log in to the system:
- admin

For this application, there is only one administrator. He can do the following:
Add, delete or edit information about a student
